Let us assume that m vehicles are located in squares (1, 1)
through (m, 1) (the bottom row) of an m Ã— m squared parking.
The vehicles must be moved to the top row, but arranged in
reverse order; so vehicle i starting from (i, 1) must end up in (m
i + 1, m). On each time step, each of the m vehicles is restricted
to move only one square up, down, left, or right, or keep current
position (i.e. does not move); but if a vehicle does not move, one
other adjacent vehicle (but not more than one) can hop over it.
Two vehicles cannot occupy the same square.
